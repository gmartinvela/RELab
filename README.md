RELab
=====

RELab is a Remote Elevator Laboratory to test control algorithms on logical programmable devices. RELab uses a [Spartan-3 board](http://www.digilentinc.com/Products/Detail.cfm?Prod=S3BOARD) programming in VHDL to manage the elevator and a [Microchip PICDEM.net 2](http://www.microchip.com/stellent/idcplg?IdcService=SS_GET_PAGE&nodeId=1406&dDocName=en028217) to manage the web services.
RELab works!, but it has a very simple interface done in a half a day.

```javascript
"TODO: Upload the UCFs and the full VHDL and Microchip project!" 
```

The actual version is 1.0.

**Hey, check out WebLab-Deusto project! <http://weblab.deusto.es>**

## Requirements ##

RoMIE is developed on a Ubuntu 12.04 system, running:

   * [Python 2.7](http://docs.python.org/2/)
   * [Django 1.5.1](https://www.djangoproject.com/â€Ž)
   * [python-mysqldb 1.2.3](http://mysql-python.sourceforge.net/MySQLdb.html)
   * [mysql-server 5.5.32](http://www.mysql.com)
   * [Supervisord](http://http://supervisord.org/)
   * [Apache2](http://httpd.apache.org/)

It might work with other versions.

## Setting up the environment and config ##

To put in production only needs a little configuration in apache httpd.conf.

	$ sudo nano /etc/apache2/httpd.conf

In this file put this two lines at the start of the file:

	WSGIScriptAlias /RELab/app/ /home/[your user]/[path to RELab]/RELab/wsgi.py
	WSGIPythonPath /home/[your user]/[path to RELab]/

And add this line to the end of that file:

	Alias /RELab/static/ /home/[your user]/[path to RELab]/RELab/static

With that done, like any Django project, put your terminal in the root directory of the project and type:

	$ python manage.py syncdb

and put the file supervisord.conf in the path: 

	cp [RELab_root_path]/supervisord.conf /etc/supervisord.conf

put the file supervisord in /etc/init.d and configure it:

	cp [RELab_root_path]/supervisord /etc/init.d/supervisord
	sudo chmod +x /etc/init.d/supervisord
	sudo update-rc.d supervisord defaults
	sudo service supervisord start

You can access to the interface in the same machine on:

	0.0.0.0:8008/RELab

or in another machine (i.e. a mobile device) connected to the same LAN on:

	[MachineLanIP]:8008/RElab
